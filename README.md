# ETHentbright Contracts
Solidity contracts for ETHentbright dApp

ETHentbright is a decentralized weapon against one of the main challenges of our time: flaking. It allows users to create a decentralized event where atendees must deposit money in order to register.

Attendees can retrieve their refund when the host reveals a secret code at the event. If the host fails to have the event, or does not give out the secret, the attendees can vote to recover their deposits. If half of the attendees vote, they may claim their refund.
