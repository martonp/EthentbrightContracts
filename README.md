# ETHentbright Contracts
Solidity contracts for ETHentbright dApp

Allows users to create a decentralized event where atendees must deposit money in order to register. ETHentbright is a decentralized weapon against one of the main challenges of our time: flaking.

Attendees can retrieve their refund when the host reveals the secret at the event. If the host fails to have the event, or does not give out the secret, the attendees can vote to recover their deposits. If half of the attendees vote, they may claim their refund.
